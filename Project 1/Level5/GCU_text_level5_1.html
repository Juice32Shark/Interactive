		<span class="blod Our">"Our story is about the gods."</span> <br>
		<p class="Arial it">It starts with a human high school and a gods' academy. <br>
		The protagonists are not some school idols, but just a few problem students who<br> are involved in the matter of life and death.<br><br> 
            In this era of confrontation between<br> gods and gods, those teenagers who should have been high school students were<br> forced to experience life and death, best friends turned against each other,<br> isolation and helplessness, and were thrust into the center of the vortex of fate. <br>
	<br>	In the face of conspiracy and reality, they have to grow up quickly no matter they're<br> human or gods, take charge of their own affairs, and reclaim the era of their own. </p></p>
