  <h3>
<p>The Xuanhuang Society is a relatively large and well-known new god organization in the Asian branch of GCU. Its overall administrative structure is a centralized system. As it has existed since the Tang Dynasty, its departmental system is similar to the system of Three Departments and Six Ministries in the Tang Dynasty.<br>Specifically, the center of power is the Cabinet, which is directly in charge of the major departments at the lower levels. Each department is marked by the mythical beast represented by the ancient astronomy. <br><br>Each department is briefly described below:</p>

</h3>

<p>The Cabinet

The central management institution of military and political centralization. It mainly consists of a president, four vice presidents, and 7-9 top opinion members (composed of representatives in each department, and several family leaders, and the lineup changes from time to time). Responsible for all internal and external instructions and decision-making on important matters. The decision will directly affect the future of all the new gods in the Xuanhuang society, and all departments will act according to the instructions of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>The Martial Department
The logo is the astrology of the Western White Tiger, represents the god of war.

The armed department of the Xuanhuang Society is also responsible for the public security among the new gods, the intervention of armed forces, and all the protection operations. It is a reliable combat force defense and military intelligence enforcement department equivalent to a police station and military defense fortress.
Martial Arts Academy (Academy of the Martial Department)
The school to train the new generation of armed forces. Generally, all the new gods who do not refuse the request will be arranged here to learn the basic courses of the use of god’s power, and then choose whether to stay in the Martial Department to continue to study and become a full member of it according to the assessment of the learning results and personal wishes.</p>
<p>The Information Tech Department

The information department of the Xuanhuang Society is also responsible for the public security between the new gods, the collection of internal and external information, and all the secret documents and Internet operations. It is a reliable information protection and document execution department equivalent to the police station and intelligence bureau.
Information Tech Academy (Academy of the Information Tech Department)
The school to train the new generation of information security management. Generally, the new gods who do not refuse the request will be arranged here to learn the basic courses of the use of god’s power and basic cultural knowledge, and then choose whether to stay and continue to develop in the Information Tech Department according to the assessment of the learning results and personal wishes. However, the Xuanhuang Society generally emphasizes martial arts over knowledge-acquired course, and the study supervision of the Martial Arts Academy is much stricter, so there are very few new gods in the Information Tech Academy, and most of them study knowledge in human schools.</p>

<p>The Prison Department
The logo is the astrology of the Northern Black Tortoise, represents the imprisoned shadows.

The prison holds evil gods and criminals. Gods identified as suspects are also detained there until evidence against them is cleared. It is divided into imprisonment, house arrest, reform, death penalty (handed over to the Martial Department), torture (handed over to the Punishment Department) and so on. It is a place that many new gods are afraid of. According to legend, a lot of powerful evil gods and dangerous criminals of new gods are imprisoned.</p>

<p>The Punishment Department
The logo is the astrology of the Below Dragon Horse, represents the punishment to break the evil.

Individual organizations formed with omnipotence, specialization, and loyalty. The overall name is “Judges”, but each has its own ideals, values and judgments. Most of them are anti-heroism and advocate individuals.They have the right to lynch. Most of them help the Cabinet to complete some extremely secret or underground missions.</p>

<p>The Laboratory Department
The logo is the astrology of the Above Soaring Serpent, represents the hidden in the fog.

The high level of the Xuanhuang Society secretly passed the bill to research and experiment with scientific research institutions that cultivate artificial new gods. By using the Wu family as sample, they secretly created a number of powerful artificial new gods, some of whom directly served in the Punishment Department after graduating from the laboratory.</p>
