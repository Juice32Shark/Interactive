  <h1><b>Xuanhuang Society in GCU</b></h1>
  <h2>From <em>"OHMYGOD"</em></h2>

  <h4>
<p>The Xuanhuang Society is a relatively large and well-known new god organization in the Asian branch of GCU（The GEOMANIST CLUB of the UNIVERSE）. 
  <br>Its overall administrative structure is a centralized system. As it has existed since the Tang Dynasty, its departmental system is similar to the system of Three Departments and Six Ministries in the Tang Dynasty.
  <br>Specifically, the center of power is the Cabinet, which is directly in charge of the major departments at the lower levels. Each department is marked by the mythical beast represented by the ancient astronomy. 
  <br><br>Each department is briefly described below:</p>

<h3><b>Information Tech Academy</b></h3>
<b><i>Academy of the Information Tech Department</i></b><br>
The school to train the new generation of information security management. Generally, the new gods who do not refuse the request will be arranged here to learn the basic courses of the use of god’s power and basic cultural knowledge, and then choose whether to stay and continue to develop in the Information Tech Department according to the assessment of the learning results and personal wishes. However, the Xuanhuang Society generally emphasizes martial arts over knowledge-acquired course, and the study supervision of the Martial Arts Academy is much stricter, so there are very few new gods in the Information Tech Academy, and most of them study knowledge in human schools.
