    <p>Officially founded in 1703,this new god organization spans all seven continents and is present in 63 different parts of the world.</p>
    <p>
    <h6>[The following is an excerpt from the stele of Gyak Bramk,
      the first general president of GCU, in Amdo, Tibet.]</h6>
    "In the past, when<br>
    gods, demons and human co-existed,
    we were divided by regions due to the lack of information sharing and the weakness of the<br>
    old gods in different parts of the world,
    and there were thousands of protoss tribes with vastly different cultures, languages and<br>
    regions.
    "Through the different versions of myths and legends that circulate around the world,
    we have a tacit understanding that<br>
    there must be others outside our own region who share our own powers,
    <h4><em>"power of the GOD."</em></h4>
    </p>
    <p>Today, the organization has become the world's largest and most sophisticated new God group, and it continues to recruit the elite<br>
      of the era.
      Adhering to the belief of inclusiveness, diversity and evolution,
      it has seven sub-organizations on seven continents, each<br>
      with its own management and governance system.
    <h6> Among them, the largest and most complex sub-organization is it's Asian organizationï¼Œ<a href="file:///Users/juice/Documents/GitHub/Interactive/Project%201/Level2/GCU_text_level2_3.html">Xuanhuang Society</a>. </h6>
